           WHAT ARE HYSTEROSCOPY AND LAPAROSCOPY SURGERIES?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-format">
           Infertility is symbiotic with anomalies in the womb or abdomen. Two primary procedures are employed to detect inconsistencies in these areas. A hysteroscopy is performed with the aim of examining potential problems in the uterus that may be leading to infertility. It is done using a fine device known as a hysteroscope, which is clipped with a tiny camera and light on its beak. It is then passed through the vagina, upwards towards the endometrium. Similarly, a laparoscopy procedure is a keyhole to a woman's abdomen and pelvic region and is especially useful to treat cysts, endometriosis and fibroids, in addition to a host of other conditions. This technique uses a laparoscope, a lightweight tool that is inserted through incisions made in the abdomen, to view an array of organs.

            WHY CHOOSE HYSTEROSCOPY AND LAPAROSCOPY SURGERIES?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-format">
            A hysteroscopy and a laparoscopy usually go hand in hand, working together to provide your fertility consultant with a view of your endometrial landscape. There are several reasons why these procedures may be recommended.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="h1-color">
            ANOMALIES IN UTERUS
        </h3>
        <p class="text-format">
           In some cases, the shape or size of the uterus may be out of the ordinary, proving hostile for an embryo. In other cases, the presence of scar tissue could be a hindrance to fertility. The hysteroscopy and laparoscopy procedures spotlight and treat anomalies like these.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3 class="h1-color">
           TUBAL INFERTILITY
        </h3>
        <p class="text-format">
          For women whose fallopian tubes are blocked at the uterine openings, natural conception may be hampered. By sliding fine tools through a hysteroscope, your fertility consultant may be able to open the fallopian tubes.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="h1-color">
           RECURRENT MISCARRIAGES
        </h3>
        <p class="text-format">
           Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy procedures are also recommended if you have experienced recurrent miscarriages, or house small fibroids or polyps in your uterus. On Cloudnine, these twin techniques are useful tools in gauging the cause of infertility.
        </p>

            ARE HYSTEROSCOPY AND LAPAROSCOPY SURGERIES RIGHT FOR ME?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-format">
          If you experience severe bleeding out of turn, or suffer from abnormal pain in your abdomen, it is recommended that you consult a gynaecologist. Although these conditions may not have a bearing on your fertility, your doctor may recommend hysteroscopy and laparoscopy routines to assess possible scenarios.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="row box px-5 py-5 my-5">
        <h2 class="h1-color">
            WHAT ARE THE STEPS OF HYSTEROSCOPY AND LAPAROSCOPY SURGERIES?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-format">
         Although hysteroscopy and laparoscopy routines are performed
         differently, they can be broadly broken down into five fundamental
         steps.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-5">
            1. OPENING
        </h3>
         <p class="text-format">
             In a hysteroscopy, your doctor will first dilate the cervix, to allow it to become wide enough to accommodate a hysteroscope. In a laparoscopy, on the other hand, a tiny incision measuring about one centimetre is made in the abdomen, just north of the belly button.
         </p>
         
         <h3 class="mt-5">
           2. INSERTION OF HYSTEROSCOPE
        </h3>
         <p class="text-format">
            During a hysteroscopy, once the cervix is sufficiently widened, a hysteroscope is slid gently through the vagina and cervix and into the uterus. Likewise, a laparoscopy entails the insertion of a laparoscope through an incision in the abdomen.
         </p>
         
         <h3 class="mt-5">
          3. INSERTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE
        </h3>
         <p class="text-format">
            In a laparoscopy, your doctor will insert carbon dioxide through a tube, to inflate the abdomen. In a hysteroscopy, regular saline is instilled into the uterus to clear away any traces of blood or mucus.
         </p>
         
         <h3 class="mt-5">
           4. EXAMINATION
        </h3>
         <p class="text-format">
            Once the uterus has been expanded and cleansed, the small light attached to the beak of the hysteroscope or laparoscope is flicked on, allowing your doctor to assess the abdominal and uterine cavities.
         </p>
         
         <h3 class="mt-5">
           5. SURGERY
        </h3>
         <p class="text-format">
            Sometimes, a procedure may reveal abnormalities in the abdominal cavity that need to be corrected through surgery. In such a case, your doctor may perform a small operation through the hysteroscope or laparoscope, using minute tools.
         </p>
         
    </div>
     
    <div class="row box px-5 py-5 my-5">
        <h2 class="h1-color">
            WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF HYSTEROSCOPY AND LAPAROSCOPY SURGERIES?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-format">
         Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy procedures are considered extremely safe, but invasive procedures, however routine, are prone to complications if not handled adequately.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-5">
            INTRAUTERINE SCARRING
        </h3>
         <p class="text-format">
            Both techniques present the risk of scarring or injury to the cervix, uterus or bladder if not done by a seasoned specialist. 
         </p>
         
         <h3 class="mt-5">
          INFECTION
        </h3>
         <p class="text-format">
            Invasive procedures like these could be potential triggers for infections if the tools used are not sterilised, or if the environment is contaminated. That's why, our facilities are meticulously sanitised after every surgery and procedure, ensuring the highest standards of hygiene.
